This is my submittion to the Titanium Network Proxathon!

## Setup & installation

To Setup Sodium it is quite simple. Below are some instructions to get you started!

**NOTE that as of right now we don't have quick deployments set up but I plan on adding support for this at some point in the future.

### Steps

- Fork This Repository, Clone into the repository by using: `git clone https://github.com/z1g-project/sodium.git`, or download the [Latest Release](https://github.com/z1g-project/sodium/releases) and extract it to your deployments directory.
- Make sure that you have NodeJS 18.x installed to check this in your operating system of choices command line or terminal type: `Node --Version` and if it says either 18.0.0 or anything later than that your fine. If you need to install or update NodeJS Please Refer to [This Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Next after all these things have been compleated. Make sure your in the directory that has all the files inside of it. Next Run `npm i` or `npm install` (they are basicly the same command) and wait for it to finish installing Dependencies.

⚠️ Note if your on Replit, Glitch, Heroku (or any other host that doesnt allow proxys) This Repository will probably automaticly flag your repository. Check out how to Bypass these Restrictions here: [Bypassing Restrictions](https://github.com/holy-unblocker/website-aio/wiki/Circumventing-deployment-restrictions)

- Once all dependencies are installed you may run `npm start` to start the HTTP Server. If you wish to use a site such as cloudflare pages or any other static hosts it is possible you just need to follow [This guide](static-hosting.md)
